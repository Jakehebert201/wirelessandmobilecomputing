### P 4.5: The following matrix represents a generator matrix for a (7,4) block code.

| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |


What is the corresponding check matrix?

This matrix is made of a 4x4 information segment then the 3x4 parity portion.

P, the parity section is 

| 1 | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |

The transposition of P, P^T is:

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

In order to get the parity check, we need to add a 3x3 identity patrix to P^T

| 1 | 0 | 0 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |

P^T + 3x3 identity matrix

| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |


### P 4.6 Find the linear block code generator matrix **G**, if the code generator polynomial is g(x) = 1 + x^2 + x^3 for a (7,4) code.

g(x) = 1 + (0*X) + (1 * X^2) + (1 * X^3) = 

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|

We need to use the polynomial in the first line of the generator matrix, then right shifting by one for each subsequent row
row 1 : 1,0,1,1,0,0,0

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

### P 4.7 Repeat p4.6 if g(x) = 1+x^3 for a (7,4) code
